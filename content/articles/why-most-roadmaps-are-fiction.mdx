## The Honest Truth About Roadmaps

Most product roadmaps are exercises in collective fiction. A team sits in a room, moves cards around a Jira board, and produces a document that confidently states what will be built in Q3 next year.

Then reality arrives. A competitor launches something unexpected. A key assumption fails validation. An engineer leaves. The roadmap quietly becomes obsolete — but nobody officially says so, because the roadmap has taken on a life of its own as a commitment to stakeholders.

The result: teams build the wrong things, faster.

## Why This Keeps Happening

The roadmap problem is fundamentally a social problem dressed up as a planning problem. Roadmaps serve multiple audiences with incompatible needs:

**Executives** want predictability and a sense that things are under control.

**Engineers** want enough clarity to do meaningful work without constant re-prioritisation.

**Sales and marketing** want a laundry list of upcoming features they can use in conversations.

**Customers** want to know their pain points are being addressed.

A single static roadmap cannot honestly serve all of these needs simultaneously. So teams produce documents that *look* like a plan while hedging enough to maintain optionality. This satisfies no one and misleads everyone.

## A Better Mental Model: Horizons

One of the more durable frameworks I've seen in practice is the **three-horizon approach**:

**Horizon 1 (Now — next 6 weeks):** High confidence. Specific deliverables. Clear owners. This is where commitments live.

**Horizon 2 (Next — 2 to 4 months):** Medium confidence. Themes and goals, not features. Directionally correct, details TBD.

**Horizon 3 (Later — 4+ months):** Low confidence. Strategic bets. Explicitly marked as speculative.

The key is communicating these horizons differently to different audiences — and being explicit about the confidence level associated with each. When everyone understands that Horizon 3 is a *hypothesis*, not a commitment, the social pressure that keeps bad roadmaps alive starts to dissolve.

## Making It Stick

The hardest part isn't designing a better roadmap format — it's changing the norms around what a roadmap *means*.

A few things that help:

**Date the confidence, not just the feature.** When something moves to Horizon 1, mark when that happened. This creates a paper trail that validates your forecasting accuracy over time and builds genuine credibility.

**Kill the feature-first instinct.** Roadmaps should be outcomes-first, features-second. "Reduce onboarding drop-off by 20%" is a roadmap item. "Add a progress bar to the onboarding flow" is a solution hypothesis. One leaves room to be right; the other doesn't.

**Make the roadmap a living document, not a quarterly artifact.** The moment it becomes a thing you update four times a year, it becomes political. Roadmaps updated weekly (even lightly) are harder to game.

## The Real Goal

A good roadmap doesn't predict the future accurately — that's impossible. It makes your current best thinking visible, creates a shared language for prioritisation, and degrades gracefully when reality diverges from the plan.

Honesty about uncertainty isn't a weakness in a roadmap. It's the thing that makes it trustworthy.
