## Introduction

This article demonstrates the power of MDX - a format that lets you use JSX directly in your markdown files. You can now seamlessly blend markdown text with interactive React components!

## What is MDX?

MDX stands for **Markdown + JSX**. It lets you write markdown like you normally would, but with the added ability to import and use React components directly within your content.

## Creating Custom Components

You can define components right in your MDX file and use them throughout the article:

<InfoBox title="💡 Pro Tip">
Define reusable components at the top of your MDX file and use them anywhere in your article. This keeps your content DRY and maintainable!
</InfoBox>

### Component Examples

Here's what you can do:

1. **Interactive Elements** - Like the counter above
2. **Custom Styled Boxes** - Like the info box
3. **Data Visualizations** - Charts, graphs, etc.
4. **Code Sandboxes** - Embedded demos
5. **Forms** - For user input and interaction

## Getting Started

To add a React component to your MDX articles:

```jsx
export const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>Hello from React!</div>
);

Then use it like: <MyComponent />
```

<InfoBox title="📚 Next Steps">
Edit your article files in `content/articles/` with the `.mdx` extension. Import your components at the top and use them inline!
</InfoBox>

## Advanced Usage

You can also import components from your codebase:

```jsx
import { Alert } from '@/components/ui/alert'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'

<Alert>
  <Button onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}>Click me</Button>
</Alert>
```

Try editing any MDX file to add your own components!
